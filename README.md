# HelloWorld

Hi there!
My name is Marina and i'm learning to use GitHub. Now i'm on my way to do test excercise for Javarush traineeship, i'm studying new technologies as Maven, Tomcat, String, Hibernate, Github etc. Sometimes it seems to me, that it all is too complicated, but i hope that i will succeed!
